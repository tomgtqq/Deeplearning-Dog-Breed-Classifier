# Dog Breed Classifier (Pytorch)

  It's the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, The algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Running APP

### Detect Humans face

Utilize OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  

OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).

### Classify Dog Breeds
Utilize transfer learning to create CNN, reference [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf).
* if a dog is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.

* if a human is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.
if neither is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error.
